# Typescript Development Pack

[This pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=aalpgiray.typescript-development) includes visual studio code extensions that I find useful for Typescript development.

## Included Extensions

### [Npm Intellisense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=christian-kohler.npm-intellisense)

Npm Intellisense
Visual Studio Code plugin that autocompletes npm modules in import statements.

### [Markdown Lint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint)

The Markdown markup language is designed to be easy to read, write, and understand. It succeeds - and its flexibility is both a benefit and a drawback. Many styles are possible, so formatting can be inconsistent. Some constructs don't work well in all parsers and should be avoided. For example, here are some common/troublesome Markdown constructs.

markdownlint is a Visual Studio Code extension that includes a library of rules to encourage standards and consistency for Markdown files. It is powered by markdownlint for Node.js which is based on markdownlint for Ruby.

### [Git Lens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens)

GitLens supercharges the Git capabilities built into Visual Studio Code. It helps you to visualize code authorship at a glance via Git blame annotations and code lens, seamlessly navigate and explore Git repositories, gain valuable insights via powerful comparison commands, and so much more.

### [TypeScript TSLint Plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscode.vscode-typescript-tslint-plugin)

This extension works using VS Code's built-in version of TypeScript and a local or global install of tslint. You do not need to configure the plugin in your tsconfig.json if you are using VS Code's version of TypeScript.

### [Npm Scripts](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eg2.vscode-npm-script)

This extension supports running npm scripts defined in the package.json file and validating the installed modules against the dependencies defined in the package.json.

### [Prettier - Code formatter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)

VS Code package to format your JavaScript / TypeScript / CSS using Prettier.

### [Mocha sidebar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=maty.vscode-mocha-sidebar)

Mocha test explorer for Visual Studio Code

### [Debugger for Chrome](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msjsdiag.debugger-for-chrome)

A VS Code extension to debug your JavaScript code in the Google Chrome browser, or other targets that support the Chrome DevTools Protocol.

### [Docker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PeterJausovec.vscode-docker)

The Docker extension makes it easy to build, manage and deploy containerized applications from Visual Studio Code, for example:

- Automatic `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, and `.dockerignore` file generation (Press `F1` and search for `Docker: Add Docker files to Workspace`)
- Syntax highlighting, hover tips, IntelliSense (completions) for `docker-compose.yml` and `Dockerfile` files
- Linting (errors and warnings) for `Dockerfile` files
- Command Palette (`F1`) integration for the most common Docker commands (for example `docker build`, `docker push`, etc.)
- Explorer integration for managing Images, running Containers, and Docker Hub registries
- Deploy images from Docker Hub and Azure Container Registries directly to Azure App Service
- Debug .NET Core applications running in Linux Docker containers
- [Working with docker](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/azure/docker) will walk you through many of the features of this extension

### [Visual Studio IntelliCode - Preview](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VisualStudioExptTeam.vscodeintellicode)

The Visual Studio IntelliCode extension provides AI-assisted productivity features for Python, TypeScript/JavaScript and Java developers in Visual Studio Code, with insights based on understanding your code context combined with machine learning.
